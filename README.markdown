== py-yajl: Python bindings for Yet Another JSON Library ==


=== Introduction ====
py-yajl is a C-based Python module to interface
with Yajl (Yet Another JSON Library). While modules like `jsonlib`, 
`simplejson` and `cjson already exist, py-yajl is intended on providing
pythonic access to Yajl's extremely fast string and stream parsing 
facilities.
